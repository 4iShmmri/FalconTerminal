# Falcon Terminal

A fast, native **macOS terminal emulator** written entirely in **Swift 6** with
SwiftUI + AppKit. No Electron, no WebView — a real PTY engine and a from-scratch
VT/ANSI parser rendered with CoreText.

## Features

- **Real PTY engine** (`forkpty`) — one shell, environment, and working
  directory per tab. Auto-detects zsh / bash / fish.
- **VT100 / VT220 / xterm parser** — SGR 16/256/truecolor, alternate screen,
  scroll regions, cursor/erase/insert/delete, OSC titles, DSR/DA reports.
  Runs `vim`, `htop`, `lazygit`, `claude`, and other interactive tools.
- **Tabbed, browser-style UI** — create, close, rename (single-click on the
  active tab), duplicate, reorder by drag, pin, and colorize.
- **Split panes** — nested vertical (`⌘D`) and horizontal (`⌘⇧D`) splits with
  draggable dividers.
- **SSH host manager** — saved hosts grouped by environment in a sidebar;
  connects via the system `ssh` so your keys and `~/.ssh/config` just work.
- **Unicode & Arabic** — full UTF-8, wide CJK/emoji, combining marks, and
  proper Arabic shaping + bidi (right-to-left, joined letters).
- **Inline suggestions** — fish-style ghost text from your command history
  (seeded from `~/.zsh_history` / `~/.bash_history`); accept with `→`.
- **Slash commands** — type `/new aaa` at the prompt (or press `⌘K`) to run app
  actions without leaving the keyboard.
- **Themes** — Falcon Dark, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, Solarized Dark/Light.
- **Session restoration** — tabs, split layout, per-pane working directory, and
  window position are restored on launch (with periodic autosave).
- **Profiles & Settings** — General, Appearance, Terminal, SSH, Profiles,
  Keyboard, and AI-tools sections.
